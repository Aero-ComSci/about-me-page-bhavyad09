    <h1 style="color: rgb(249, 146, 163);">About Me</h1>
    <p>My name is Bhavya Dwivedi. I am a freshman at Emerald High School. 
    When I grow up, I want to be a software engineer, which involves taking the normal Computer Science pathway in high school. 
    To achieve this, I plan on maintaining a good work ethic and good grades along with various extracurriculars that stand out 
    compared to my peers. This is my career choice because I have always been invested in computers, technology, and game design
    since a young age.</p>
    
    <p>Some strengths and personal qualities I possess are that I have a good work ethic, can manage my time decently well, and I 
    put in 100% effort in everything. This has been shown multiple times throughout my school and work experience. Some major accomplishments I 
    have from high school are that I have attended some Taekwondo tournaments for medals, and attended many trainings and seminars.
    </p>

    <p>From these experiences, I have learned that I can achieve anything that I want to. From my work experience, I have learned
    that my life is a lot easier if I complete assignments and things as soon as possible, rather than procrastinating work until 
    the last minute. Doing Taekwondo as a sport for 5 years has evoked discipline and independence inside of me, allowing me to excercise 
    other skills and strengthen my skills both inside and out of work or school.
    </p>

    <p>To sum up, I have been doing Taekwondo for six years which has given me many new skills. Amongst these are independence, discipline, 
        etc. Throughout my work experience, I have learned that I can achieve anything if I put my mind to it, provided that I give it my all 
        and put in all my effort. Thank you so much for your time in reading this section of the website. Please feel free to explore the rest 
        of my site.
